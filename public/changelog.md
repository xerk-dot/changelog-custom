- 2437: Don't export replicate from Route Handler (by Jared Palmer)
- 2438: Add replicate example and fix event termination (#405)

Fixes Replicate's non-standard SSE termination. They send an event named `done` with `data: {}` (https://replicate.com/docs/streaming). 

**The Problem**
<img width="539" alt="CleanShot 2023-08-01 at 09 29 18@2x" src="https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai/assets/4060187/9a92e64c-5448-465a-b23c-13232c8190a2">
<img width="403" alt="CleanShot 2023-08-01 at 09 29 13@2x" src="https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai/assets/4060187/c54db2db-92d2-43a8-8025-25f3974628fb">

Our current `customParser` abstraction only handles `event.data` which in the case of termination = `{}`. However, this could be part of the regular response output, and so isn't a sufficient conditional to decide termination. As a workaround, this ships an additional termination check in `AIStreamParser`. 

If we don't like this abstraction, we can refactor `customParser` to take the whole `event` and then move this logic into `ReplicateStream`. (by Jared Palmer)

### Patch Changes

-   3d29799: React/Svelte/Vue: keep isLoading in sync between hooks with the same ID.

    React: don't throw error when submitting (by github-actions[bot])
- 2449: docs/ai-stream: update to match current implementation (#393) (by Max Leiter)
- 2450: ai/react: align hooks with other implementations, don't throw error when submitting (#299)

It was reported by @steven-tey that the `isLoading` was not in-sync between different `useCompletion` calls with the same ID. 

It turns out that `useSWRMutation` ([docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/mutation#useswrmutation)) does not share state between hooks like `useSWR`. This PR switches to `useSWR` + manually making the mutation with `fetch`. This has the benefit of making the code consistent between all three versions. 

This also stops our react use-completion's internal `triggerRequest` from throwing an error to align with the other implementations.  

I'd review with [whitespace disabled](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai/pull/299/files?w=1) (by Max Leiter)
- 2451: Initial prototype supporting OpenAI Streamable (#356)

OpenAI is considering removing the `response` property from their completions API, and instead will return an pre-parsed `AsyncIterable<ChatCompletionChunk>`. That saves us from having to parse the SSE ourselves, which is nice.

Still needs testing, but I think this should work.

- 2459: ai/react: don't throw error if onError is passed (#370)

The vue, solid, and svelte utils do not use an equivalent to `useSWRMutation` and always return the caught error in the `error` returned from our client hooks. This more closely aligns the react package by having SWR not throw the error if an `onError` is passed.

- 2492: docs/guides: fix highlighted lines in langchain example (by Max Leiter)
- 2493: feat(streams): add http error handling for openai (#163)

This pull request addresses issue #144 and introduces an enhancement to the `OpenAIStream` function within the `packages/core/streams/openai-stream.ts` file. The enhancement entails the integration of conditional stream processing to manage non-2xx HTTP responses more efficiently, ensuring the synchronous nature of the function is maintained.

The key modifications in this pull request include:

- **Conditional Stream Processing**: The `OpenAIStream` function now uses conditional stream processing based on the status code of the HTTP response. This enhances the function's capability to handle different response types with greater efficiency.

- **Evaluate Response Status**: The function utilizes `res.ok` to determine if the response status code falls within the 2xx range, indicating a successful response.

- **Processing of Successful Responses**: In the event of a successful response (2xx status code), the function continues with the standard stream processing.

- **Handling of Erroneous Responses**: For non-2xx responses, the function creates a custom `ReadableStream`. If `res.body` is not null, it asynchronously extracts and decodes the response body.

- **Propagating Detailed Error Messages**: The function uses `controller.error` to propagate a detailed error message, providing more context on the nature of the error encountered.

- **Documentation Updates**: Updated JSDoc comments for the `OpenAIStream` function to reflect the new conditional stream processing approach, and provided additional information on its behavior and usage.

These modifications ensure that the `OpenAIStream` function remains synchronous while providing detailed and efficient error handling for non-2xx responses.

Please let me know if there are any additional changes or adjustments needed. (by Dann)
- 2494: Fixed merge error (#304)

This is just a simple PR to fix a booboo I made when resolving merge conflicts with the last PR. (by Archimagus)
- 2495: Function Calling In Svelte (#258)

For now I am just pushing in the state where I was with my fork of @Zakinator123's fork.  I haven't updated to all the latest comments of that branch, but I wanted to get this available for those that were looking for the Svelte version, if they wanted to clone off this branch to work locally.  I'll upate to include the rest of the changes requested in the other PR here as I can. (by Archimagus)

## ai@2.1.17

### Patch Changes

-   3ed65bf: Remove dependency on node crypto API (by github-actions[bot])
- 2498: Update Langchain version from 0.0.99 to 0.0.103 in Next + Nuxt examples (#289)

Updated version number to 0.0.103. Ref: [Link to release](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs/releases/tag/0.0.103) (by Developers Digest)
- 2499: fix: Remove dependency on node crypto API (#300)

As seen in #192 , it is currently not possible to use edge functions in SvelteKit because the node crypto API is not available in the edge runtime. The node crypto API requirement is coming from [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid/blob/main/index.js). Nanoid has an alternative export, [nanoid/non-secure](https://github.com/ai/nanoid/blob/main/non-secure/index.js), which does not depend on the node crypto API.

From their readme r.e. `nanoid/non-secure`:
```
By default, Nano ID uses hardware random bytes generation for security and low collision probability. If you are not so concerned with security, you can use it for environments without hardware random generators.
```

It seems that `ai` is only using nanoid to generate unique IDs for chat messages - IMO this is a situation where non-secure can be used, which would be great for SvelteKit users. (by Lachlan Collins)
